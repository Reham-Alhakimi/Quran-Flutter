# Quran Flutter
 Quran made with Flutter
 
[Ayat](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/ayat/?l=en) is a Quran project from King Saud University, it has the following platforms: iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web, Linux. so users have a similar experience on all the platforms, but unfortunately, this project is deprecated. The reason that is important 

1. Those who memorize Quran wants to have similar actual Mushaf experience, as an example [Quran for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quran.labs.androidquran&hl=en) or [Quran for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quran-by-quran-com-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86/id1118663303) have different Quran image than actual Madina mushaf. 

2. A person might want to switch platforms and revise their Quran reading on another platform.

After deprecating of Ayat there is no similar solution that works well on all the platforms with similar experience.

My proposal: Develop a Quran project with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), with Flutter it is possible to have a single codebase for all the platforms with similar experience while having single Codebase will make it easier to maintain and keep developing. I have started a project that is [here](https://github.com/SadaqaWorks/quran), I'm looking for more contributors.
