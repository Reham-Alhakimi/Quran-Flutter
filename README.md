# Quran Flutter
 Quran made with Flutter
 
Ayat is a Quran project from King Saud University, it has the following platforms: iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web, Linux. so users have a similar experience on all the platforms, but unfortunately, this project is deprecated. The reason that is important

Those who memorize Quran wants to have similar actual Mushaf experience, as an example Quran for Android or Quran for iOS have different Quran image than actual Madina mushaf.

A person might want to switch platforms and revise their Quran reading on another platform.

After deprecating of Ayat there is no similar solution that works well on all the platforms with similar experience.

My proposal: Develop a Quran project with Flutter, with Flutter it is possible to have a single codebase for all the platforms with similar experience while having single Codebase will make it easier to maintain and keep developing. I have started a project that is here, I'm looking for more contributors.
