## Why this project is important? 

[Ayat](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/ayat/?l=en) is a Quran project from King Saud University, it has the following platforms: iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web, Linux. so users have a similar experience on all the platforms, but unfortunately, this project is deprecated.

The reason that is important 

1. Those who memorize Quran wants to have similar actual Mushaf experience, as an example [Quran for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quran.labs.androidquran&hl=en) or [Quran for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quran-by-quran-com-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86/id1118663303) have different highly modified Quran image than actual Madina mushaf which is crucial for a memorizer to have similar look and feel for visual memorization purpose, or other alternatives aren't available across the platforms. 
2. A person might want to switch platforms and revise their Quran reading on another platform.
3. All the current projects are different in their own ways and have different codebase thus keep maintaining and adding new features is difficult.
4. After deprecating of Ayat there is no similar solution that works well on all the platforms with similar experience.


My proposal: Develop a Quran project with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), with Flutter it is possible to have a single codebase for all the platforms with similar experience while having single Codebase will make it easier to maintain and keep developing. I'm looking for more contributors.
